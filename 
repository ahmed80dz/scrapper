refactor: separate concerns into focused modules

- Break monolithic main.rs into 6 specialized modules
- Add types.rs for shared data structures and configuration
- Create csv_reader.rs for CSV parsing logic
- Add web_scraper.rs for content extraction (renamed from scraper.rs)
- Implement progress.rs for progress tracking and user feedback
- Add file_manager.rs for file system operations
- Maintain all original functionality with improved maintainability
- Fix async lifetime issues and module naming conflicts
- Remove unused code to eliminate compiler warnings
